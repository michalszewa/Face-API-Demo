# Face API Demo!

Hi! I've made this demo for my presentation about **Microsoft Azure services** and using **RESTful APIs** with it.

As a front layer here is a web site with dropzone where you can drop your image with faces to detect and analyze. I've also wanted to store uploaded images so I connected it with Azure's Blob Storage Service.
On succesfull uploading JavaScript functions are trigerred which handles jquerys AJAX calls to application backend endpoint where data are processed.
## Technologies
This web application contains two layers which was written in following technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (bootstrap framework), JavaScript (jquery AJAX for API calls to backend endpoints + JSON)
- **Backend:** C# ASP .NET Core 2 MVC + **Micorosft Azure Services:** Blob storage, Face Api Service
